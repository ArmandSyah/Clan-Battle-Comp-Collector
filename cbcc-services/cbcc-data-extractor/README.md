# CBCC-Data-Extractor (Muimi)

Basically, it will read all the required data from the current latest priconne database info, in order to retrieve characters and clan battle boss info and then push that data into the database controlled by the Rest api.

If you're interested in running this project locally, you will need to configure and run this data extractor
